This project aims to predict car prices based on various features using machine learning. It utilizes a RandomForestRegressor model to forecast car prices and employs Streamlit for interactive web deployment.


# Features
### Model:
   RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn.
### Data:
   The dataset includes features such as Car_Name, Year, Present_Price, Driven_kms, Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission, and Owner.
### Preprocessing:
   Categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder to facilitate model training.
### Deployment  
   The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
